<v Narrator>Black Black Friday.</v>

8
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.290
If you were in the Puget Sound last fall,

9
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.660
you couldn't go anywhere without seeing it,

10
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.880
hearing it, or reading it.

11
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.830
And even though it gained national attention,

12
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.270
it started right here in Seattle

13
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.710
with a simple problem:

14
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.620
that Black people make up 8% of our population,

15
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.170
but own less than 1% of the businesses.

16
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.170
And those businesses are five times more likely to close

17
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.520
than white ones.

18
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.100
So Black Black Friday was born.

19
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.270
Look around.

20
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.103
What do you see?

21
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.990
You see us guiding all that is culture

22
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.180
and giving the whole world its sense of cool.

23
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.330
With us, everything is wrapped in love.

24
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.380
A cultural movement

25
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.840
to hack the biggest shopping holiday of the year

26
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.330
to support Black-owned businesses.

27
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.700
It started with the Black Black Friday card,

28
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.370
a prepaid card that saves shoppers 20%

29
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.780
at Black-owned businesses.

30
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.940
And thanks to our friends at BECU,

31
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.430
doesn't cost those businesses a dime.

32
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.600
To spread the word,

33
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.340
we called on our community.

34
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.440
And people really came through.

35
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.060
People like Intentionalist,

36
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.630
who connected us to businesses across the Pacific Northwest.

37
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.820
Business owners who gave their time and wisdom

38
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.530
to sit on a panel and help guide the work

39
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.627
from start to finish.

40
00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:16.020
(upbeat music)

41
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.720
Artists who lent their talents to the cause.

42
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.590
Local celebrities-

49
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Narrator>And all that work paid off</v>

50
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.460
for the people who matter most.

51
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.330
<v ->To be seen outside of just your community means a lot.</v>

52
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.700
<v ->Business owners that I've been in communication with</v>

53
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.357
have all realized increased sales.

54
00:01:41.357 --> 00:01:45.030
<v ->We were, you know, up close to 60% of new customers.</v>

55
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.310
<v ->Yeah, every day is Black Black Friday now.</v>

56
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Narrator>So yeah, our little movement made a big impact,</v>

57
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.310
put money back in the pockets of Black business owners,

58
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.590
and got the people talking in a big way.

59
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.910
But if you ask us,

60
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.433
the real impact has only just begun.
