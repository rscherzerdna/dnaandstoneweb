00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.740
<v Narrator>Pabst Blue Ribbon is a classic brand,</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.610
but they'd lost relevance with folks

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.560
who drive culture forward.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.240
No offense, aging hipsters. So people think we're outdated.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.373
We think that's a good thing.

00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:19.767
♪ Where can you go where the beer is cold ♪

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Narrator>This is the place,</v>

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.460
an entire campaign transporting people

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.380
to the classic mindset that only Pabst can inspire.

13
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.600
♪ Nostalgic as hell, totally fire ♪

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Narrator>We couldn't outspend the competition,</v>

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.680
so we outsmarted them instead,

16
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.436
showing up in places that got people talking.

17
00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:50.310
♪ Everywhere you look, is Pabsty, Pabsty, Pabsty ♪

18
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Narrator>Then we made Pabst a real place</v>

19
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.835
you could actually visit at a one-of-a kind motel.

20
00:00:55.835 --> 00:01:00.540
♪ Brag to your dad that you visited Pabst ♪

21
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Narrator>From a trophy case hiding a beer fridge</v>

22
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.130
to a PBR-dispensing jukebox,

23
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.590
to a claw machine packed with cold ones.

24
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.590
All the rooms sold out.

25
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.540
People from across the country traveled

26
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.246
just to experience it and on social fans went wild.

27

♪ Oh so dope ♪

28
00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.692

29
00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:24.738
♪ Literal proof that everybody loved it ♪

30
00:01:24.738 --> 00:01:26.913
♪ For real ♪

31
00:01:26.913 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Narrator>Heck, it even got picked up by a guy named Jim.</v>

32
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.383
<v Jimmy Fallon>Well get this.</v>

33
00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:32.670
I heard that Pabst Blue Ribbon is partnering

34
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.480
with a motel in Michigan to create PBR-themed rooms.

35
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Narrator>This campaign overdelivered on all accounts</v>

36
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.730
with people talking, people drinking,

37
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.450
and PBR top of mind.

38
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.850
So now when folks want a taste of nostalgia,

39
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.965
they can simply remember...

40
00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:52.775
♪ Pabst is the place that's in our hearts ♪

41
00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:56.358
♪ Where we can be together ♪
