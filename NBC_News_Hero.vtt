00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:01.845
I turned off news altogether.

2
00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:05.285
They're bantering back and forth.

3
00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:09.365
I hate to say it, but I don't trust much of anything.

4
00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:11.515
It's all bull****.

5
00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.325
I wanna be able to form my own opinions.

6
00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:18.165
I've seen people cut their families off.

7
00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:21.285
Oh, just tell the truth.

8
00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.485
They make everything seem extreme, seem scary.

9
00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:28.645
I wish we didn't fight so much.

10
00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:33.445
I'm looking for some facts.

11
00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.965
First, tell me the facts, the truth,

12
00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.085
report things from both sides. 

13
00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:45.285
If we got clear facts, maybe we could calm down a little.

14
00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:47.125
Just talk to each other more.

15
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:49.525
That's... that's what the news is supposed to do.
