00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.302
<v Narrator>Hey, New York.</v>

2
00:00:01.302 --> 00:00:02.550
(car horns honking)
MCU is here

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.380
for those big life moves.

4
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.412
Like when your stove and clothes no longer share a room.

5
00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:08.280
(door slamming)

6
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.378
Ooh, when you buy a nice, new car that just sits there,

7
00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.510
(train whooshing)
'cause you're hopping

8
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.710
on the subway.

9
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.394
When you can officially buy in Jersey.

10
00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:16.320
(birds chirping)

11
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.120
I wouldn't recommend it.

12
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.630
I'm telling you, MCU is the not-for-profit credit union

13
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.720
born in New York to give you more for your hustle.

14
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.210
Loans and High Yield Savings.
(jazz music)

15
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.530
MCU,
(train whooshing)

16
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.553
We're Here For It.
