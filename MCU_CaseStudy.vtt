00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.358
(upbeat band music)

2
00:00:02.358 --> 00:00:05.866
(traffic whooshing, cars honking)

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.782
(upbeat band music continues)

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Narrator>Hey, New York!</v>

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.550
MCU is here for those big life moves.

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.764
Like when your stove and clothes no longer share a room.

7
00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:18.597
(door slamming)

8
00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:21.930
Ooh, when you buy a nice new car that just sits there,

9
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.880
'cause you're hopping on the subway.

10
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.490
When you can officially buy in Jersey.

11
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.260
I wouldn't recommend it.

12
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.800
I'm telling you, MCU is the not-for-profit credit union

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.890
born in New York to give you more for your hustle.

14
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.576
Loans and High Yield Savings.

15
00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:40.376
MCU. We're Here For It.

16
00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:43.376
(upbeat band music)

17
00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:51.923
(upbeat band music continues)

18
00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:56.923
(people chattering)
(upbeat band music)

19
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:04.009
(camera shuttering)
(upbeat band music)

20
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Narrator 2>Hey, New York!</v>

21
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.170
When you save enough to escape the city on August 1st,

22
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.982
then instantly miss it. (laughs)

23
00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:25.140
(traffic whooshing)

24
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.931
(subway train arriving)

25
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:28.572
(pigeons cooing)

26
00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:30.449
(hot dogs sizzling)

27
00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:33.449
(people chattering)
