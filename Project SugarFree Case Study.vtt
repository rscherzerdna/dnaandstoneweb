<v Reporter>Users describe sugar dating</v>

19
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.740
as a way for affluent men or women

20
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.480
to connect with younger people online

21
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.390
for what they call "mutually beneficial relationships".

22
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.340
Regardless of what you think of the lifestyle,

23
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.170
police say more sugar dating websites

24
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.720
and social media platforms are now being used

25
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.300
by sexual predators to lure minors,

26
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.670
and the law is struggling to keep up.

<v Narrator>Sex trafficking recruitment</v>

28
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.030
from social channels has more than doubled

29
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.160
in the last two years,

30
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.960
and often these propositions are made

31
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.780
through social media platforms like Twitter (X).

32
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.660
Project:SugarFree is a data-driven program designed

33
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.780
to put an end to sex trafficking in Washington state,

34
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.430
one tweet at a time.

35
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.400
Project:SugarFree uses data analytics tools

36
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.260
and automated AI technology

37
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.840
to identify problematic sugaring communications

38
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.780
on Twitter (X) from four key audiences

39
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.320
and intercept both potential victims and offenders

40
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.668
with tweets meant to warn and educate.

41
00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:33.030
(siren ringing)

42
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.070
Since launching, Project:SugarFree

43
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.873
has seen tremendous success.

44
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.200
93 unique exploiters were identified,

45
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.853
23 of them de-platformed.

46
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.950
While most marketing campaigns work to increase sales,

47
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.230
Project:SugarFree is working to end them,

48
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.180
ultimately saving vulnerable lives

49
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.293
from being exploited by sex traffickers.

50
00:02:57.293 --> 00:03:00.014
