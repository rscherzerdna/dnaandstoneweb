(bright piano music)
<v ->Starting over is hard</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.343
because all of my dreams and goals have had to shift.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.000
Going through a divorce,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.403
everything kind of gets turned on its head.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.850
Now it's just you.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.120
You are the one making the financial decisions

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.380
for your family,

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.820
from the little decisions, like going to the grocery store,

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.490
to wondering if I'm ever going to be able

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.143
to own a home someday.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.580
As I've gone through this process,

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.170
BECU was incredibly helpful,

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.870
making sure that I could track down the financial documents

14
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.893
that I needed or to open an account with my new name.

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.700
I'm really proud of how far I've come,

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.890
how I've been able to rebuild for myself and my family,

17
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.013
and BECU is an important part of that.
